#### **Notes on the initiative:**
1. Not just a micro-grid, but a platform for innovation for the community and by the community.
2. Blockchain to create a decentralized marketplace (i.e LO3 power ledger transactive grid)

* Additional Scenario: Kathleen not on micro-grid, but needs power. Can Irine and Jane distribute to kathleen? (Identity B.L.T. dimensions)

#### **Keep In Mind:**
* Actors
* Actions
* Data

## **Additional Thoughts:**
* What other actions would occur?
* What other roles of these actors and/or OTHER ACTORS would you envision?
* Who will run the transactive grid? blockchian, central entity?
* Would Ethereum or other cryptocurrency or other distributed ledgers offer better fit?  Is "Proof of Stake" (or "Proof of Validation") better suited to this scenario?
* What other capabilities of blockchain and related technologies would you envision as a good fit for this scenario? 
* Can we structure the techology and business model in way that's legitimately regulated as a non-public utility?
